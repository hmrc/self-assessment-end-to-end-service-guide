## Register for Self Assessment for Agents

Agents must register for, or already be registered for, Self Assessment for Agents before they can use this service. This is also known as getting an agent code - HMRC allocates the agent a Self Assessment agent code, in the format A12345.

More details are given at [Self Assessment for Agents: HMRC online services](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/self-assessment-for-agents-online-service#how-to-get-an-agent-code). We encourage you to include this link in your software.


## Create an HMRC online services for agents account

Agents must create, or already have, an [HMRC online services for agents account](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hmrc-online-services-for-agents#HMRC-online-services-for-agents-account) before they can use the service. This also gives them access to other services for agents.

They must also enrol this account for Self Assessment for Agents, which links it to their Self Assessment agent code.

They do this on GOV.UK at [HMRC services: sign in or register](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services). We encourage you to include this link in your software.


## Create an HMRC online account

Individuals must create, or already have, an HMRC online account before they can use the service. This also gives them access to their Personal Tax Account.

They do this on GOV.UK at [HMRC services: sign in or register](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services). We encourage you to include this link in your software.


## Register for Self Assessment

Individuals must register for, or already be registered for, Self Assessment before they can use this service. Once registered they get a Self Assessment Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR).

They do this on GOV.UK via their Personal Tax Account, which they access at [HMRC services: sign in or register](https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services). We encourage you to include this link in your software.


## Authorise agent

Agents must obtain authorisation from their clients to act on their behalf before they can use this service, for example using form 64-8.

They do this on GOV.UK at [Agent authorisation to deal with HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/client-authorisation-an-overview). We encourage you to include this link in your software.


## Choose software

We provide [a list of Self Assessment software applications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-assessment-commercial-software-suppliers) so agents and individuals can choose the right software for their needs.


## Link software to HMRC

Agents and individuals using your software to connect to the Self Assessment APIs must grant authority to your software to interact with HMRC on their behalf.

Because the APIs to help complete a return and the API to submit a return use different technology, the linking process is different for each.

### Help complete a Self Assessment return

We use the open standard OAuth 2.0. This involves the agent or individual signing in to their HMRC online account and following our grant authority user journey.

We then generate an access token for the user, which the software must include in subsequent API requests.

For more details see [Authorisation - user restricted endpoints](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints).
 
### Submit a Self Assessment return

The agent or individual enters their HMRC online account user ID and password directly into their software.

The software must pass them in subsequent API requests as explained in [Transaction Engine: Document Submission Protocol](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transaction-engine-document-submission-protocol).


## Get data from HMRC to help complete Self Assessment return

The individual or agent’s software can get data from HMRC to help complete some parts of the tax return.

The software does this by calling one or more of the following APIs:

* [Individual PAYE API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individuals-paye) - recommended for PAYE data, but is currently in private beta and will eventually replace the following four Individual APIs
* [Individual Benefits API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-benefits)
* [Individual Employment API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-employment)
* [Individual Income API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-income)
* [Individual Tax API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/individual-tax)
* [National Insurance API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/national-insurance)
* [Marriage Allowance API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/marriage-allowance)

Each API returns either the requested data or an appropriate error response. The most common errors are:

* no data found for the given individual and tax year
* end user not authorised for the given individual, for example an agent without client authorisation

For more details see the above API documentation.

To use these APIs, your application must comply with our [terms of use](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/terms-of-use). You must accept the terms of use before we issue your application’s production credentials.


## Complete and submit Self Assessment return

Once they have completed the Self Assessment return in their software, the individual or agent submits it to us online. To do this, their software uses the following API:

* [Self Assessment Online XML API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/xml/Self%20Assessment%20Online)


## Get help and support

Individuals and agents can get help and support via the following channels:

* you as their software supplier
* the “Get help with this page” link on relevant pages in the grant authority journey - for help with signing in, 2-step verification, identity checks and granting authority
* the [HMRC Online Services Helpdesk](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/online-services-helpdesk) - for help with technical queries that the software supplier can’t resolve
* the [HMRC Income Tax Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees) - for individuals querying the data received from HMRC
* the [HMRC Agent Dedicated Line](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/agent-dedicated-line-self-assessment-or-paye-for-individuals) - for agents querying the data received from HMRC
